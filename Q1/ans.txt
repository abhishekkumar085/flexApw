CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout):

One-Dimensional Layout: Flexbox is primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column. It allows you to create flexible and dynamic layouts along a single axis.
Content-Centric: It's particularly useful for aligning and distributing items within a container, especially when dealing with content of varying sizes. This makes it great for creating navigation menus, lists, and card layouts.
Use Cases: Flexbox is suitable for scenarios where you have a set of items with unknown or dynamic sizes and want them to adapt to the available space efficiently.
CSS Grid:

Two-Dimensional Layout: CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to create both rows and columns. This makes it more versatile for complex layouts.
Grid Control: It provides precise control over the placement of items within a grid, making it ideal for creating complex web designs, such as magazine-style layouts, responsive grids, and overall page structures.
Use Cases: CSS Grid is best used when you need to create grid-based layouts, such as those found in web applications, multi-column content, or overall page structure.

When to Choose One Over the Other:

Flexbox: Use Flexbox when you need to align items along a single axis or when dealing with a simple layout where items flow either horizontally or vertically. It's great for organizing content within a single row or column.

Grid: Choose CSS Grid when you need to create complex layouts with both rows and columns. It's ideal for designing web pages with multiple sections, where you want precise control over the placement of elements.
