1. justify-content (Justify Content Property):

justify-content controls how flex items are distributed along the main axis within the flex container.
It determines the horizontal alignment of items.
Common values include:
flex-start: Items are aligned to the start of the container.
flex-end: Items are aligned to the end of the container.
center: Items are centered within the container.
space-between: Items are evenly spaced with the first item at the start and the last item at the end, creating space between items.
space-around: Items are evenly spaced with equal space around them.
space-evenly: Items are evenly spaced with equal space around and between them.


2. align-items (Align Items Property):

align-items determines how flex items are aligned along the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main axis) within the flex container.
It controls vertical alignment.
Common values include:
flex-start: Items are aligned to the start of the cross-axis.
flex-end: Items are aligned to the end of the cross-axis.
center: Items are vertically centered within the container.
baseline: Items are aligned based on their text baseline.
stretch: Items are stretched to fill the container vertically.

3. gap (Gap Property):

The gap property (or row-gap and column-gap for older implementations) sets the spacing between flex items in a grid layout.
It specifies the space between rows and columns of flex items.
You can use it to add horizontal and vertical spacing between items without using margins or padding.

4. flex-direction (Flex Direction Property):

flex-direction determines the direction of the main axis within the flex container.
It controls whether items are arranged horizontally or vertically within the container.
Common values include:
row: Items are arranged in a horizontal row (default).
row-reverse: Items are arranged in a horizontal row, but in reverse order.
column: Items are arranged in a vertical column.
column-reverse: Items are arranged in a vertical column, but in reverse order.

5. flex-wrap (Flex Wrap Property):

flex-wrap controls whether flex items should wrap to the next line if they don't fit within the container's main axis.
It affects how items flow when there isn't enough space along the main axis.
Common values include:
nowrap (default): Items remain on a single line.
wrap: Items wrap to the next line if necessary.
wrap-reverse: Items wrap to the next line, but in reverse order.
